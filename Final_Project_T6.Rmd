# ABSTRACT
 
  With the main goals of this extensive project being to maximize the effectiveness of promotional activities, improve overall satisfaction, and increase customer engagement, we conducted a thorough analysis of Starbucks' marketing strategies. Our analysis involved a deep dive into Starbucks' customer data, using a variety of visualizations and statistical methods to uncover insights. 

  Our initiative's primary goal was to increase customer satisfaction and engagement. Our goal was to determine the best channels for promotions and tailor our products to each individual customer's needs. We used a variety of sophisticated modeling methods, such as k-means clustering, logistic regression, decision trees, and support vector machines (SVM), to accomplish this. These models were crucial in helping us understand consumer preferences and behavior. Our strategy is expected to improve the efficacy and efficiency of Starbucks' to improve the efficiency of guaranteeing the company's sustained customer satisfaction and market dominance. It is fully documented in a R Markdown file in our GitHub repository.


# INTRODUCTION

  Our project examines the interactions and transactions of 17,000 customers using the Starbucks Customer Dataset. We use K-Means clustering for customer segmentation using data from responses (transcript.csv), customer demographics (profile.csv), and offers (portfolio.csv). With the use of this method, strategies can be more precisely targeted by identifying unique behavioral and demographic patterns. Through the analysis of purchase behaviors and offer responsiveness, our goal is to improve customer engagement and promotional efficacy at Starbucks.

# SUMMARY OF DATASET

The data is contained in three files: portfolio.csv - data about offers sent to customers (10 offers x 6 columns) profile.csv - demographic data of customers (17,000 customers x 5 columns) transcript.csv - customer response to offers and transactions made (306,648 events x 4 columns)

### PORTFOLIO

```{r, results='markup'}

library(dplyr)

# EXPLORATORY DATA ANALYSIS


## Age and Gender

```{r, results='markup'}
# Create a side-by-side boxplot and histogram
par(mfrow = c(1, 2), mar = c(5, 4, 4, 2))
boxplot(profile_new$age, xlab = "Age", main = "Boxplot", col = "lightblue")
hist(profile_new$age, xlab = "Age", main = "Histogram", col = "lightblue")

# Adjust axis label sizes
par(cex.lab = 1.5)

# Print descriptive statistics
summary(profile_new$age)
age_sd <- sd(profile_new$age)

# Print the standard deviation
cat("Standard Deviation of Age:", age_sd, "\n")
```

1) The customer age range spans from 18 years as the youngest to 101 years as the oldest.

2) The distribution of customer ages appears to approximate a normal distribution, with a mean and standard deviation of approximately 54 and 17, respectively.

## Gender distribution.
```{r, results='markup'}
library(ggplot2)
library(plotly)

# Create a data frame with the count of each gender category
gender_counts <- table(profile$gender)

# Calculate percentages
gender_percentages <- round((gender_counts / sum(gender_counts)) * 100, 1)

# Define custom colors
custom_colors <- c("#FF6F61", "#6B5B95", "#88B04B")  # You can use any color codes you like

# Create the 3D pie chart
pie_chart <- plot_ly(
  labels = names(gender_counts),
  values = gender_counts,
  type = "pie",
  textinfo = "label+percent",
  marker = list(colors = custom_colors),
  pull = c(0.1, 0.1, 0.2)  # Adjust pull for exploding wedges
) %>%
  layout(
    title = "Gender Distribution",
    scene = list(
      aspectmode = "cube",  # Center the chart
      camera = list(eye = list(x = 1.25, y = 1.25, z = 0.85))  # 3D view settings
    ),
    showlegend = FALSE
  )

# Display the 3D pie chart
pie_chart
```


1) The customer base consists of a larger proportion of males (57.2%) compared to females (41.3%), with a minor representation (1.4%) from customers identifying with other genders.



## Data distribution among different events.

```{r, results='markup'}
library(ezids)
# Get value counts for the 'event' column
event_value_counts <- table(transcript_new$event)
# EDA on event occurences
# Load the required libraries
library(ggplot2)
library(plotly)

# Create a data frame from the event counts
event_counts_df <- data.frame(event = names(event_value_counts), count = as.numeric(event_value_counts))

# Define a vector of colors for  four events
event_colors <- c("Coral", "Cyan", "Magenta", "Turquoise")

# Create a ggplot2 bar chart 
p <- ggplot(event_counts_df, aes(x = event, y = count, fill = event)) +
  geom_bar(stat = "identity") +
  scale_fill_manual(values = event_colors) +
  labs(title = "Event Distribution", x = "Event", y = "Count") +
  theme_minimal() +
  scale_y_continuous(breaks = seq(0, max(event_counts_df$count), by = 20000)) +
  coord_flip() +
  theme(panel.border = element_rect(color = "black", fill = NA),
        panel.grid = element_blank(),
        axis.text.x = element_text(face = "bold", color = "black"),
        axis.text.y = element_text(face = "bold", color = "black")) 

# Make the ggplot2 chart interactive using plotly
interactive_plot <- ggplotly(p)

# Display the interactive plot
interactive_plot
```

As expected, not all recieved offers were viewed and not all recieved offers were completed. The dataset contains 45% transaction events and 55% offer events.

## Percentages of each offer type sent.

```{r, results='markup'}
colors <- c("#ad6a6c", "#d0ada7", "#e8d6cb")

# Count the frequency of each offer type
offer_counts <- table(new_portfolio$offer_type)

ggplot(data = as.data.frame(offer_counts), aes(x = Var1, y = Freq)) +
  geom_bar(stat = "identity", fill = colors, color = "black") +
  labs(title = "Frequency of Each Offer Type",
       x = "Offer Type",
       y = "Count") +
  scale_fill_manual(values = colors)
```

From the above observation BOGO and the discount offer type has the maximum count of nearly 66,000 and 62,000 respectively while the informational offer had the least count.



```{r, results='markup'}
# Load the ggplot2 library
library(ggplot2)

# Create a scatterplot
ggplot(profile_new, aes(x = gender, y = income, color = gender)) +
  geom_jitter(width = 0.3, alpha = 0.7, size = 1) +
  labs(title = "Scatterplot of Income vs Gender", x = "Gender", y = "Income") +
  scale_color_manual(values = c("#E41A1C", "#377EB8", "#4DAF4A")) +  # Custom colors
  theme_minimal() +
  theme(plot.title = element_text(hjust = 0.5),
        panel.grid.major.y = element_line(color = "gray90"),
        axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 45, hjust = 1))

```

1) Male customers have a right-skewed income distribution, indicating that a larger proportion of male customers falls within the lower half of the income spectrum among the company's customer base.

2) Male customers have a right-skewed income distribution, indicating that a larger proportion of male customers falls within the lower half of the income spectrum among the company's customer base.

3) Female customers have a significantly higher average income compared to customers of other genders. This disparity in income may be attributed to the assumption that female customers, on average, are older than customers in other gender groups.

4) On average, female customers have an income of \$71,000, while male customers have an average income of \$61,000. Customers of other genders have an average income of \$63,000.

## Income vs Gender vs Age
```{r, results='markup'}
# Load necessary libraries
library(plotly)
library(dplyr)

# Create a 3D scatterplot with Plotly
scatter_3d <- profile_new %>%
  plot_ly(x = ~age, y = ~income, z = ~gender, color = ~gender, colors = c("#E41A1C", "#377EB8", "#4DAF4A"),
          type = "scatter3d", mode = "markers",
          marker = list(size = 2)) %>%
  layout(scene = list(xaxis = list(title = "Age"),
                     yaxis = list(title = "Income"),
                     zaxis = list(title = "Gender")))

# Show the 3D scatterplot
scatter_3d
```


-   Income tends to increase with age for both men and women. This is evident from the fact that the scatterplot shows a general upward trend from left to right.

-   Another interesting thing we can observe is that female customers with higher incomes, on average, are older than customers in other gender groups.

The customer base consists of a larger proportion of males (57.2%) compared to females (41.3%), with a minor representation (1.4%) from customers identifying with other genders. The customer age range spans from 18 years as the youngest to 101 years as the oldest. The income of customers spans from 30k to 120k, with an average income of 65.4k. The income distribution closely mirrors that of the general population. There is a logical relationship between age and cafe visits, as individuals between 46 and 75 years tend to have more available time to visit cafes. The income distribution varies between genders, with females having higher average incomes




# DATA MODELLING

## SMART Q1: How can we design a precise predictive model to classify customer responses to offers as successful or not?
Now that we have analyzed the dataset, we will proceed by creating a model that would predict whether a user will respond to an offer or not. There are 4 scenarios that can happen:

A user will view and complete the offer.
A user will just view the offer.
A user will not view the offer, but will complete it anyway (without prior knowledge of the offer existence)
A user will not view the offer and will not complete it.

Since starbucks are targetting users that will view the offer and complete it afterwards, our prediction would be a binary value as such: 1: User will view and complete the offer 0: Otherwise


In order to proceed with the prediction, we will need to create a new dataframe that will include the targeted features and the prediction column. The features that will be analyzed are:

Age
Income
Gender
Offer_type
Reward
Duration
Difficulty
Channels

A new column will be created "offer_success" to show wehther a user will successfully view and complete the offer.

From the datasets, Offer types BOGO and discount have a clear criteria for completion and can be founded by looking at the event column with value "completed offer" and then double check that the timing of completion and viewing and offer expiration are consistent.

However, dealing with informational offers is different. Since informational offers are advertisement offers that don't have a completion criteria, we will need to define how to consider them successful.

One way would be to look at all transactions and check if a transaction has occurred during an informational offer period. These transactions are considered to be influenced by the offer and thus the informational offer was successful. This is, of course, under the condition that a user has received and viewed the informational offer, THEN proceed to make a transaction.

In order to do that,  create one dataset that includes all pairs (user_id and offer_id) of completed offers for Bogo and discount. Also create another dataset that includes all pairs (user_id and offer_id) of completed offers for type informational.

Next, will merge them together into a bigger dataset including all successfully completed offers.


```{r, results='markup'}
library(dplyr)

# Filter offer_received_df
offer_received_df <- transcript_new %>%
  filter(offer_received == 1) %>%
  select(offer_id, user_id, time) %>%
  rename(time_received = time)

# Filter offer_viewed_df
offer_viewed_df <- transcript_new %>%
  filter(offer_viewed == 1) %>%
  select(offer_id, user_id, time) 
  


# Filter offer_completed_df
offer_completed_df <- transcript_new %>%
  filter(offer_completed == 1) %>%
  select(offer_id, user_id, time) 

# Merge offer_completed_df and offer_viewed_df
complete_bogo_discount_df <- merge(offer_completed_df, offer_viewed_df, by = c('offer_id', 'user_id'))

# Merge with offer_received_df
complete_bogo_discount_df <- merge(complete_bogo_discount_df, offer_received_df, by = c('offer_id', 'user_id'))

complete_bogo_discount_df <- complete_bogo_discount_df %>%
  rename(time_completed = time.x, time_viewed = time.y)


complete_bogo_discount_df <- merge(complete_bogo_discount_df, new_portfolio, by = 'offer_id')

# Display the resulting data frame
head(complete_bogo_discount_df)
```


```{r, results='markup'}
library(dplyr)


complete_bogo_discount_df <- complete_bogo_discount_df %>%
  mutate(time_expire = time_received + duration * 24)

# Display the resulting data frame

```
```{r, results='markup'}

    time_completed <= time_expire
  )

# Display the resulting data frame

Three classifier algorithms will be used

1.LinearSVC
2.Decision Tree Classifier
3.k-nearest neighbors

To evaluate a model, we will look into f1-score. The F1 score can be interpreted as a weighted average of the precision and recall which conveys the balance between them.

Looking at Precision value alone would ignore the False Negatives and would make us miss valuable customers that can potentially complete an offer.

Similarity, looking at Recall value alone would ignore False Positives which can make us send offers to everyone and flood users with offers they are not interested in.

For that, F1 score is the best choice in this case as it provides the balance between them.

**OBSERVATION:**

In this logistic regression model, we aim to predict `offer_success` based on features such as `offer_reward`, `difficulty`, `duration`, and communication channels. Despite achieving a high accuracy of 99.93%, the model's effectiveness is questionable due to several concerns:

1. *Class Imbalance*: The dataset shows a significant imbalance between classes, which could lead to a bias towards predicting the majority class, thereby inflating accuracy.

2. *Sensitivity Concerns*: The low sensitivity (60.42%) indicates the model's limited ability in correctly identifying true positives for the minority class.

3. *Potential Overfitting*: The high accuracy might be indicative of overfitting, especially if the test set does not represent the overall population diversity.

4. *Metric Reliability*: Sole reliance on accuracy is misleading in imbalanced datasets; alternative metrics like F1-score or AUC-ROC are recommended for a more comprehensive evaluation.

In summary, while the model shows high accuracy, its real-world applicability is limited by issues like class imbalance, potential overfitting, and an over-reliance on accuracy as the primary performance metric. Addressing these concerns is crucial for developing a more robust and reliable predictive model.

**OBSERVATION:**

In this improved logistic regression model, we addressed previous limitations through regularization and class imbalance correction. We employed the ROSE package for oversampling the minority class in our training data, leading to a more balanced dataset. Additionally, we utilized the glmnet package to apply elastic net regularization, a combination of L1 and L2 regularization techniques, enhancing the model's ability to generalize and reducing the risk of overfitting.

The new model's performance was evaluated using a confusion matrix and accuracy. The accuracy decreased to 87.96%, a more realistic figure considering the previously imbalanced nature of the dataset. Notably, the sensitivity increased to 94.92%, indicating a significantly improved ability to correctly identify true positives for the minority class. The specificity also remained high at 87.95%, confirming the model's effectiveness in identifying true negatives.

**Key improvements in this model include:**

1. *Handling Class Imbalance*: Oversampling the minority class created a more balanced training dataset, allowing the model to learn more effectively from both classes.

2. *Regularization*: The use of elastic net regularization helped in reducing overfitting by penalizing complex models, thus enhancing the model's generalizability.

3. *Realistic Accuracy*: The adjusted accuracy presents a more realistic view of the model's performance in a balanced scenario.

4. *Improved Sensitivity*: The substantial increase in sensitivity demonstrates the model's enhanced capability in detecting the minority class.

Overall, these adjustments led to a more robust and reliable logistic regression model, better suited for practical applications due to its improved handling of class imbalance and overfitting.

legend("bottomright", legend = paste("AUC =", round(auc_value, 4)), col = "blue", lwd = 2)
```
**OBSERVATION:**
The ROC-AUC curve displayed represents the performance of the improved logistic regression model. The curve illustrates the trade-off between sensitivity (true positive rate) and specificity (true negative rate) across different thresholds. The AUC (Area Under the Curve) value is a summary measure of the curve; in this model, the AUC is 0.9727.

An AUC of 0.9727 suggests a high degree of separability between the positive and negative classes, indicating that the model is capable of distinguishing between the two with high accuracy. The closer the AUC is to 1, the better the model is at predicting 0s as 0s and 1s as 1s. An AUC value significantly higher than 0.5, which would represent a random guess, indicates that the model has a strong predictive performance.

In summary, the ROC-AUC curve and the high AUC value of 0.9727 reflect the model's robustness and its improved ability to identify both classes accurately, signifying a substantial advancement from the initial logistic regression approach.

**OBSERVATION:**

for the improved decisoin tree model:
The enhanced Decision Tree model was developed to address the shortcomings of the initial model, notably the class imbalance and potential for overfitting. To this end, we applied the ROSE package to perform oversampling, creating a balanced representation of classes in the training data. We also refined the model by selecting the most relevant features and incorporated regularization techniques by setting the complexity parameter (`cp`) and the minimum number of observations that must exist in a node for a split to be attempted (`minsplit`).

The model's accuracy post-improvement stands at 87.96%, lower than the initial model but more indicative of its true performance given the balanced dataset. The substantial improvement in sensitivity to 94.92% demonstrates the model's enhanced capability in correctly identifying the minority class, which is critical in imbalanced datasets.

Furthermore, the application of pruning parameters in the decision tree has helped to mitigate overfitting by avoiding an overly complex tree that perfectly fits the training data at the expense of generalization.

In conclusion, the improved Decision Tree model represents a more accurate and reliable classifier than its predecessor. By addressing class imbalance through oversampling and incorporating regularization to combat overfitting, we have achieved a model that not only performs better on balanced data but also has a greater potential to generalize to unseen data. This has been substantiated by a more balanced accuracy, indicating improved model performance across both classes.


**CONCLUSION:** Based on the provided information and the AUC values from the ROC curves, the improved logistic regression model with an AUC of 0.9727 outperforms the improved Decision Tree model with an AUC of 0.9143. The higher AUC value for the logistic regression model indicates a superior ability to distinguish between the successful and unsuccessful offers. This is a significant metric in evaluating model performance, particularly in classification tasks where the objective is to maximize the correct identification of both positive and negative classes while minimizing the error rates.

Moreover, the logistic regression model displayed a balanced accuracy and an improved sensitivity over the initial model, which further suggests its enhanced capability to generalize and perform well on unseen data. In conclusion, the improved logistic regression model is deemed better in terms of the metrics used for evaluation in this context.

**OBSERVATION:**

The ROC-AUC curve presented for the improved Decision Tree model demonstrates its classification strength with an AUC of 0.9143. This value indicates a strong ability of the model to differentiate between the classes of 'offer success'.

# CONCLUSION

## SMART Q1

To design a precise predictive model for classifying customer responses to offers as successful or not, we implemented and iteratively improved logistic regression and decision tree models. By addressing class imbalance with techniques like oversampling and applying regularization methods to reduce overfitting, we enhanced the models' predictive accuracies and generalization capabilities. The logistic regression model, after refinement, yielded an AUC of 0.9727, indicating a high ability to differentiate between classes and showing strong model performance. Meanwhile, the improved decision tree model achieved an AUC of 0.9143, which, while very good, was less indicative of an optimal performance than the logistic regression model.

Evaluating both models' AUC values, sensitivities, specificities, and overall accuracies, the improved logistic regression model emerged as the more precise classifier for predicting customer responses. The combination of data preprocessing, feature selection, model evaluation, and fine-tuning led to the development of a robust predictive model that meets the objective of accurately classifying customer responses to offers.

## SMART Q2

1. Following the analysis using the Elbow method, we separated the entire set of data into four optimal clusters and then performed K-means clustering.
2. The SVM model is then trained to anticipate cluster membership. The confusion matrix shows an excellent accuracy , with precision, sensitivity, and specificity all above 99%. These are very encouraging results. 

To conclude, these metrics show that the model performs well in detecting both positive and negative information, and it is very effective at classifying data into the appropriate clusters with few errors. This degree of precision and accuracy shows that the model is strong and trustworthy when it comes to generating predictions using the dataset.
